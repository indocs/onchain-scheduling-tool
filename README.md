# onchain-scheduling-tool

Practical on-chain scheduling with gas-aware, auditable execution for robust governance and deployments.

Outline
- What it is
- Architecture overview
- Local development workflow
- Testing strategies (including revert scenarios)
- Deployment flow
- Security considerations

Quickstart
1. Install dependencies
2. Configure local node (Hardhat Network)
3. Compile, test, and deploy

Deployment
- Deploy locally via Hardhat script
- Verify on Etherscan (optional) using Hardhat plugin hooks

Hardhat-Specific Notes
- Uses env-driven RPC URLs (via dotenv)
- Gas-aware execution is surfaced through events and deterministic timestamps
- Minimal access control with owner-based permissions for critical operations
